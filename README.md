# OOP244: C++ Language Workshops and Milestones - Summer 2023

This is a repository, which serves as a comprehensive record of the workshops and milestones I completed during the OOP244 C++ language course at Seneca College in the summer of 2023. 
This course was instrumental in advancing my understanding and application of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts using C++, further solidifying my programming foundation with a hands-on, project-based approach.

## Course Highlights
Throughout this course, I engaged deeply with C++ to explore and implement core OOP principles, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. 
The workshops and milestones were designed to challenge my understanding and prompt me to apply theoretical concepts in practical scenarios, enabling me to develop robust, efficient, and scalable C++ applications.

## Workshops and Milestones
The workshops and milestones throughout the course served as pivotal learning experiences, each with its own unique focus but together providing a comprehensive exploration of advanced programming techniques in C++. 
These components demanded not just an understanding but a mastery of several key concepts, which include:

#### Advanced Class Design
I applied object-oriented principles to develop complex, scalable software systems. This involved using encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism to build efficient and adaptable software architectures.

#### STL Containers
I extensively used the Standard Template Library for efficient data management. Projects featured the application of vectors, lists, maps, and sets to solve various data handling challenges, showcasing C++'s flexibility.

#### Error Handling and Debugging
Emphasizing software reliability, I learned to implement robust error-handling using exceptions and developed debugging skills to ensure software quality, using tests and tools to identify and fix issues effectively.
